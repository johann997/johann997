##  How's it going, my name's Johann. 

I spent my early days in **Belfast, Northern Ireland** ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª and my University years in **Vancouver, Canada** ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ pursuing Quantum Transport Physics at the graduate level. 
Currently I am in **Berlin, Germany** ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª working on Data Science / Machine Learning projects. 


I am curious about making sense of the world around us. From modelling optimal running routes in Vancouver, to web-scraping nutritional websites for cost-effective healthy foods and using Facebook marketplace data to determine competitive pricing, I love telling stories through data-driven decisions. :)
