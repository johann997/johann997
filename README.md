## PAST
I spent my early days in **Belfast, Northern Ireland** üáÆüá™ and my University years in **Vancouver, Canada** üá®üá¶, where I obtained my M.Sc. in Physics with a specialisation in Quantum Transport. Here is a repo for my [Masters Thesis](https://github.com/johann997/QDEV_masters_thesis) and a website link to the [Quantum Devices Group](https://phas.ubc.ca/~qdev/?p=home) which I worked in for 3 years. I worked on everything from coding in Pyton, IGOR, MATLAB and SQL üíª,  to designing electronic components ‚ö°, managing cryogenic ‚ùÑÔ∏è and high-vacuum equipment üî©, to all steps of device fabrication in an ultra high clean room ü•º. These are the necessary steps to measure a fractional change in electrons charge :electron: required for our research.
</br>

## PRESENT
Currently I am in **Berlin, Germany** üá©üá™, transitioning into Quantum Computing, working on Data Science projects and enjoying the centuries old history here!

## WHAT GETS ME EXCITED?
I am curious about making sense of the world around us. From modelling optimal running routes in Vancouver, to web-scraping nutritional websites for cost-effective healthy foods and using Facebook marketplace data to determine competitive pricing, I love telling stories through data-driven decisions. :)
