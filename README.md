##  How's it going, my name is Johann. 

I spent my early days in **Belfast, Northern Ireland** 🇮🇪 and my University years in **Vancouver, Canada** 🇨🇦. Where I obtained my M.Sc. in Pyhysics with a specialisation in Quantum Transport. Here is a repo for my [QDEV_masters_thesis](https://github.com/johann997/QDEV_masters_thesis) and a website link to the [QDEV lab](https://phas.ubc.ca/~qdev/?p=home) I worked in for 3 years. 
</br>
Currently I am in **Berlin, Germany** 🇩🇪 and working on Data Science / Machine Learning projects. 


I am curious about making sense of the world around us. From modelling optimal running routes in Vancouver, to web-scraping nutritional websites for cost-effective healthy foods and using Facebook marketplace data to determine competitive pricing, I love telling stories through data-driven decisions. :)
